# myswaywm
My custom config files of SwayWM and mutual apps

If you so happen to wander over here, you can do whatever you want with the code, as long as you dont scam or make people pay in any way for it. I chose GPLv3 because it seemed as the most widespread and fitting license.

I have to say that I left a lot of trash comments in, from the original config file or from failed/past attemps, so the readability is not all that high
